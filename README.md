## Overview

### The challenge

This challenge was to refactor the given codebase for accessibility by adding semantic markup to the HTML and adjusting the CSS file accordingly. The original files provided can be viewed in the source folder of this repository.

### User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

### Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS

### What I learned

This challenge really helped me better understand coding for accessibility and the importance of designing with accessibility in mind. Moving forward I will always be using semantic elements where they are called for and do my best to avoid using div tags everywhere.

### Continued development

The page now has high scores for Accessibility and Best Practices in the Chrome Dev Tools Lighthouse utility, but still scores low in SEO, and Performance. Moving forward I would like to work on improving site performance, and increasing SEO scores.

### Useful resources

- [W3.ORG ARIA Landmarks](https://www.w3.org/TR/2021/NOTE-wai-aria-practices-1.2-20211129/examples/landmarks/index.html) - This page really helped me understand ARIA landmarks and how they relate to semantic HTML. It was very useful in helping me figure out which semantic elements to add to the page based on the content those elements represent.
